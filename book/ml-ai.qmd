# Machine Learning and AI in Libraries {.unnumbered}

## Introduction


AI is mentioned absolutely everywhere these days, in movies, in the news, in our library strategies and our funding calls, but what does it really mean and is anyone even using it correctly? Let's try to get to the bottom of this!

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is actually a really broad field of computer science (and an umbrella term) that refers to the research and development of systems and machines capable of doing tasks that typically require human intelligence to perform, such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and perception. Sometimes folks may think AI refers to systems and machines that actually having true intelligence, and though todays AI systems are shockingly convincing in how well they perform, what we're seeing really are just very advanced machine learning algorithms performing specific and discrete functions, and we're a long way off (if ever) from machines having sentience (or, Generalised Artificial Intelligence (GAI), so don't worry! 

These days, AI can be further divided into "Traditional AI" which is the type of work we make a whole lot of use of in the library world such as using machine learning algorithms for tasks such as classifying data (e.g., assigning labels to images, automatically transcribing handwritten texts, or identifying genre of digitised texts) and "Generative AI" which refers broadly to systems whose primary function is to generate new content (conversation, books, art, etc). This is where your ChatGPT systems comes under for instance.

Whenever AI is being discussed you may often hear the term **machine learning** mentioned, and sometimes theyâ€™re used interchangeably which can be confusing. Machine learning is more specifically a core technology that is itself a main subfield of AI and also underpins the other subfields of AI such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV).

Machine learning (ML) focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn patterns and relationships from data and make predictions on new data. Instead of being explicitly programmed for specific tasks, ML algorithms use data to learn and improve their performance over time.

A **machine learning algorithm** is designed to recognize patterns, relationships, and trends in data, and they adjust their internal parameters based on examples to improve their performance over time. Machine learning algorithms play a crucial role in various applications.

A **machine learning model** represents what was learned by a machine learning algorithm. The model is created and saved after running a machine learning algorithm on training data. The model represents the rules, numbers, and any other algorithm-specific data structures required to make predictions on new data.

In the next section we'll consider one particularly common use case in order to walk us more practically through the concept of machine learning: automatic transcription of handwritten text. 

### But first, a quick Review Time!

*Which of the following do you think would use Machine Learning?*

1. Counting the number of people in a museum using information from entry and exit barriers.
2. A search system that looks for images similar to a user submitted sketch.
3. A system that recommends library books based on what other users have ordered.
4. A queueing system that spreads people evenly between 5 ticket booths
5. A program which extracts names from documents by finding all capitalised words and checking them against a list of known names
6. A system which turns digitised handwritten documents into searchable text
7. A robot which cleans the vases in a museum without bumping into them or breaking them
 

If you answered 2, 3, 6 & 7 you are correct! The others could all be easily programmed using a simple set of easily defined rules.

## Relevance to the Library Sector

Transkribus case study as an example of how models and algorithms work.

>Let's say you have 20,000 pages of handwritten manuscripts that you would like to transcribe and turn into machine readable text to allow for better search for your researchers. A task of this scale would be far too for any one, or even two, staff members to attempt. This is where machine learning comes in....
