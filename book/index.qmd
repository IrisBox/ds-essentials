## What are _Digital Scholarship & Data Science Topic Guides for Library Professionals_ (**DS Topic Guides**)?

Over the past few decades, the development of excellent self-paced tutorials and training materials for undertaking digital scholarship and data science in libraries have proliferated online. 

For library professionals who are relatively new to this area however, it can be hard to know where to begin! Without knowing a little bit about the context of how new technologies are being deployed in research libraries, this dearth of resources can seem quite daunting. Even if you might have an idea of what learning youâ€™d like to undertake, it can be difficult and time consuming to try and navigate the wealth of individual training resources out there on your own.

**DS Topic Guides are written for and by research library professionals across LIBER https://libereurope.eu/ to help share some of our experience and knowledge and lower those barriers to entry for others!** 

Each Topic Guide aims to provide a gentle, quick and curated introduction to the key topics and technologies we grapple with in Digital Scholarship and Data Science today:

- Introduction to the topic
- Relevance to the library sector (Case studies/Use cases)
- Hands-on activities and other self-guided tutorial(s)
- Recommended Reading & Viewing
- Finding Communities of Practice

## Are **DS Topic Guides** for me?
Are you someone working in or around research libraries with an interest in learning more about how to do cool and interesting things with digital collections and data at your institution? Wondering how data science techniques can help you in your work? Are you interested in gaining valuable digital literacy skills and knowledge to support emerging areas of modern scholarship such as Digital Humanities? Do you need some of the technology jargon you hear about these days demystified?

Then this resource is for you!

It is very important to us that the guides here are inclusive and intellectually accessible, challenging but not terrifying and as such we focus primarily on an introductory audience where no programming or particular digital skills are required.

Though written from the research library professional perspective we think these guides will be useful for anyone currently (or aspiring to be) working in and around digital collections and data in heritage institutions:

- Library & Information Science students
- Project managers
- Developers
- Information specialists
- Metadata Managers
- Subject librarians
- System librarians
- Institutional leadership

And so many more!
