# Contribute to Our Project {.unnumbered}

We are currently working on producing the first complete edition of this resource for launch at the [LIBER Annual Conference](https://liberconference.eu/) 3-5 July 2024. Topic Guides are currently being produced through a series of in-person and online writing sprints of LIBER working group members and by direct invitation. When complete, the first edition will be deposited in the [British Library Research Repository](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/), captured in the UK Web Archive, and a DOI provided for both the overall resources and individual guides. 

The first edition Topic Guide list draws heavily on the existing skills framework and topics covered in the British Library’s Digital Scholarship Training Programme, as well as those recommended by attendees of development workshops hosted by LIBER working groups throughout 2023/2024.

- Join one of the [LIBER Working Groups Digital Scholarship and Digital Cultural Heritage WG](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/digital-scholarship-and-digital-cultural-heritage-collections-working-group/) or [Data Science in Libraries](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-data-science-in-libraries-working-group/) (open to all staff of [LIBER member institutions](https://libereurope.eu/liber-participants/)) to keep up with the developments and ongoing maintenance of this project!

## Join a Writing Sprint! 
> <mark>Our next Topic Guide Sprint is **Tuesday May 14, 2024 9:00-11:00 (BST):** [**Register Today!**](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=t0ykIcP5AE-a-r0ejoi82X7ZIEJh0odPq9ej1FnpQEJUNTlTTTQ3WjBWU0gxOTdaNk1WSUpVV1FPRS4u)</mark>

If you would like to take part please [Register Today](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=t0ykIcP5AE-a-r0ejoi82X7ZIEJh0odPq9ej1FnpQEJUNTlTTTQ3WjBWU0gxOTdaNk1WSUpVV1FPRS4u) to be sent the meeting calendar invite, sprint details and access to your Topic Guide Template in case you want to prep/get started early. Feel free to contact [digitalresearch@bl.uk](mailto:digitalresearch@bl.uk) with any questions!

**Preparing for the sprint:**

1. Please have a quick read through the [**Welcome**](index.qmd) and [**Topic Guide**](topicguides.qmd) pages to familiarise yourself with this resource and its purpose.
2. When you [**Register**](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=t0ykIcP5AE-a-r0ejoi82X7ZIEJh0odPq9ej1FnpQEJUNTlTTTQ3WjBWU0gxOTdaNk1WSUpVV1FPRS4u) you'll see a list of our latest Topic Guides on our wishlist. Please check off any and all Topic Guides you would be happy to work on during the day of the sprint. On the day each attendee will focus on writing just **one** Topic Guide however. The information you provide before the sprint will help us organise this ahead of time so that as many Topic Guides as possible have at least one dedicated author.  
3. Please have a quick read through the **Contribution Guidance and Style Guide** section. 
4. We'll be in touch after we receive your registration to send you more details and useful information ahead of the sprint. If you are sent a copy of the [**Topic Guide Template (Google Doc)**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1okdNMn1Jg1M8Enzavuqe_elsWH0uV1p1?usp=sharing) that corresponds to your topic of choice ahead of time, add your name to the header, and feel free to add notes or even make a start on drafting your guide before the sprint day if you're keen! 

**What to expect on the day**

**After the sprint**

During the workshop, you’ve been working on your Topic Guide in a Google Doc. This Google Doc can continue to serve as a ‘living document’ following the workshop until you feel the content is ready to be published to Digital Scholarship and Data Science Essentials for Library Professionals. Throughout this process, we would like to maintain an overview of the docs in terms of their status and action points using the functionality offered by GitHub Issues. 

At the end of the sprint therefore, we will have asked you to head over to GitHub and open an ‘Issue’ to start a submission of your Topic Guide. We have provided an issue template which is pre-formatted as a submission checklist. Please go through the issue template and provide the necessary information relating to where the submission is currently at. Once the issue is saved, it can continue to serve as a space to continue discussion of the ongoing status of your submission and log updates where necessary, including notifying us of when it is fully ready for final review by maintainers. 

Things to note when creating an Issue for your newly created Topic Guide under development:

- If you want to include resources such as images and videos etc. which cannot be linked to via the web - you might have to provide the files themselves to us. You can attach any local files as a comment on the Issue you have created for your Topic Guide. 
- Any references used should also be added to the Zotero library and/or provided in BibTex format.
- You may request placing your Google Doc under restricted access if you wish. We will not do this by default, but we respect that some contributors would like to keep drafts private until fully ready for submission.

When your Topic Guide is ready for our review in Google Docs, please let us know by logging an update over on Github as a comment on the issue stating this. You can also tag the maintainers so they receive a notification as well. Maintainers will generally work with you on the final edits necessary for the submission through track changes and comments within the Google Doc itself. Once these have all been resolved maintainers will log a status update indicating “Review complete; Final Submission Ready; Make live” in the GitHub issue.

## Ongoing Maintenance and Review

We view this resource as capturing a snapshot in time and will endeavour to fully review all content a minimum of once annually to check for link rot, and content relevancy. The project team editors are committed to make quick fixes when raised throughout the year, while formal sprints and reviews coinciding with LIBER Annual Summer Conference and Winter events will be used for soliciting new content and undertaking more complex updates to the resource each year.
