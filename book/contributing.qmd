# Contribute to our Project {.unnumbered}

Throughout 2023/2024 we are working on producing the first complete edition of this resource for launch at the [LIBER Annual Conference](https://liberconference.eu/) 3-5 July 2024. That edition will be deposited in the [British Library Research Repository](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/), captured in the UK Web Archive, and a DOI provided. Topic Guides are currently being produced through a series of in-person and online writing sprints of LIBER working group members and by direct invitation. Each Topic Guide will have its own DOI as well.

The first edition Topic Guide list draws heavily on the existing skills framework and topics covered in the British Library’s Digital Scholarship Training Programme, as well as those recommended by attendees of development workshops hosted by LIBER working groups throughout 2023.

## Ways to contribute to this project

1. Write a new Topic Guide 
2. Contribute to an existing Topic Guide or Additional Resources by opening an issue or adding to existing ones on Github
3. Propose a new Topic Guide by starting a discussion on GitHub 
4. Join one of the LIBER Working Groups Digital Scholarship and Digital Cultural Heritage Collections or Data Science in Libraries (open to all staff of LIBER member institutions)

## 1. Writing a new Topic Guide 
> **Note**  
These guidelines are written specifically for attendees wishing to contribute to the writing of Topic Guides on our wishlist as part of the Topic Guide Sprint being held on **Tue May 14, 2024 9am - 11am (BST)**. If you would like to take part please contact digitalresearch@bl.uk to be sent the meeting calendar invite.

1. Please have a quick read through the Welcome and Topic Guide pages to familiarise yourself with this resource and its purpose.
2. Have a look at our Topic Guide wishlist beforehand and put your name against existing topics you’re available to work on. 
3. Please familiarise yourself with the Contribution Guidance and Style Guide section below
4. Find the Topic Guide Template (Google Doc) that corresponds to your topic of choice in this folder and get writing! 
5. At the end of the sprint, open an Issue in Github using the Issue Template to let us know what the status is of your Topic Guide (for example is it ready to be reviewed/published or does more need doing after the sprint).
6. When you are ready to submit, either at the end of the workshop or later on, please follow the directions under “Submission Guidelines-For Contributors”


### *Guidance and Style Guide* 

Each Topic Guide must include a Header Section composing of a title, contributor information, and suggested citation. This is followed by five key content blocks detailed below. Please have a look at the IIIF Guide as an example of how these pieces all fit together into one complete Topic Guide.

#### Header Section

- **Topic Guide Title**: IIIF
- **Contributor(s) Name & (Orcid ID)**:  Nora McGregor (ORCID iD)
- **Suggested Citation**:  Nora McGregor, “IIIF,” *Digital Scholarship & Data Science Essentials for Library Professionals* (2024), [DOI link]

Note: The project team will ensure each Topic Guide is given an individual DOI either through British Library or Zenodo. 


#### Content Blocks
 
##### I: Introduction to the topic (*Approximately 300-500 words*)
This introduction section should be pitched at a beginner/foundational level and gives a concise overview of the topic. It should be written in a relaxed and natural way. 

>Imagine that a colleague has come to you casually asking about the topic over tea. How might you go about explaining it to them in your own words? During the course of that casual conversation what key things would you leave in and what might you leave out in the interest of getting them to a basic understanding quickly?

This section does not need to contain the world’s knowledge, just enough high-level knowledge to get the key concepts across. Linking can be used liberally for jargon busting throughout if explaining a particular term is more complex than our word count allows.

##### II: Relevance to the Library Sector  (*Approximately 300-500 words*)
This section provides a clear explanation of the topics’ specific relevance to the work of libraries.

It should contain:

- A short paragraph or two setting the scene as to why the topic is relevant to the work of libraries. Here you might also like to present opportunities and, if relevant, potential challenges for libraries around the topic as well.
- 1- 3 examples of real world (or potential) applications/case studies/projects briefly explained in a 100 max word summary provided each with links to further information if available. Note that it is not necessary to write up or create a new case study yourself here! Rather, we’re looking for briefly summarised references to existing ones. If there are quite a few other examples the contributor would like to reference include, links to these can be added at the end of this section (Example: “For further case studies, visit….”).

##### III: Hands-on activity and other self-guided tutorial(s) 
The objective of this section of the topic guide is to enable learners to familiarise themselves with the basics of the topic via self-paced tutorials and hand-on activities. The aim of this section, in other words, is to provide selected links to online learning materials which have proven valuable and can be personally recommended for library professionals. 

The tutorials listed in this section should be suitable for independent study, and they should consist of detailed explanations of the steps learners can follow to develop the needed competencies. They may consist of textual explanations or of video recordings, and they may be in any European language. 

For the sake of consistency across the various topic guides, it is helpful if these paragraphs are structured as follows:

- The opening sentence should state the name of the resource, the URL (added as a hyperlink), and citation information, preferably in BibTex format
- The remainder of the paragraph might then explain why the Topic Guide author recommends the tutorials, an explanation of the relevance or the value of the tutorial, and, optionally, an indication of topics covered and the level of complexity. 
- The paragraph should conclude with a short discussion of the exercises that are provided in the tutorial. For instance, add a personal touch as to why you are personally recommending this particular tutorial. 
Each tutorial reference paragraph should contain no more than 200 words.

In addition to such pointers to existing tutorials, authors of topic guides may also discuss exercises or other hand-on activities that may help to develop an understanding of the topic at hand. Such suggestions for hands-on activities may take various forms, and these guidelines do not prescribe a strict format. Authors may choose to include a practical exercise, a link to a well-documented github repository, or a link to a GLAM workbench. 

##### IV: Recommended Reading & Viewing  
The section on recommended reading and viewing contains references to more passive learning resources such as:

- Open access articles discussing the topic at a general level, or containing contextual information.
- Video recordings of lectures about the topic, which do not demand practical activities from the viewer
Podcasts about the topic

[\ # TODO: How should authors link to publications? Instruction here on how to use the Zotero Library?]

##### V: Taking the next steps
This section provides guidance to library professionals on where to take their learning journey further. It should include:

- Where to find (local/national/international) Communities of Practice or other relevant networks and organisations who can help with furthering their understanding of the topic. 
- If relevant you might also point to specific summer school courses, conferences and events that may further enhance learning. 


### *Submitting your Topic Guide*
During the workshop, you’ve been working on your Topic Guide in a Google Doc. This Google Doc can continue to serve as a ‘living document’ following the workshop until you feel the content is ready to be published to Digital Scholarship and Data Science Essentials for Library Professionals. Throughout this process, we would like to maintain an overview of the docs in terms of their status and action points using the functionality offered by GitHub Issues. 

At the end of the sprint therefore, we will ask you to head over to GitHub and open an ‘Issue’ to start a submission of your Topic Guide. We will provide an issue template which is pre-formatted as a submission checklist. Please go through the issue template and provide the necessary information relating to where the submission is currently at. Once the issue is saved, it can continue to serve as a space to continue discussion of the ongoing status of your submission and log updates where necessary, including notifying us of when it is fully ready for final review by maintainers. 

Things to note when creating an Issue for your newly created Topic Guide under development:
- If you want to include resources such as images and videos etc. which cannot be linked to via the web - you might have to provide the files themselves to us. You can attach any local files as a comment on the Issue you have created for your Topic Guide. 
- Any references used should also be added to the Zotero library and/or provided in BibTex format.
- You may request placing your Google Doc under restricted access if you wish. We will not do this by default, but we respect that some contributors would like to keep drafts private until fully ready for submission.

When your Topic Guide is ready for our review in Google Docs, please let us know by logging an update over on Github as a comment on the issue stating this. You can also tag the maintainers so they receive a notification as well. Maintainers will generally work with you on the final edits necessary for the submission through track changes and comments within the Google Doc itself. Once these have all been resolved maintainers will log a status update indicating “Review complete; Final Submission Ready; Make live” in the GitHub issue.
