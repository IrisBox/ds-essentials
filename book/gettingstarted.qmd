## Introduction
This guide aims to give a quick overview of the main competency frameworks, reports, networks and communities of practice for library professionals in European Research Libraries to get started in digital scholarship & data science. 

## Relevance to the Library Sector (Case Studies/Use Cases)  

Throughout DS Topic Guides you'll find a plethora of individual case studies and use cases for undertaking digital scholarship and data science. Here we present a number of reports and publications which articulate the broad sectoral view of why such skills are necessary for library professionals. 

### LIBER Publications

- [LIBER Digital Skills for Library Staff & Researchers Working Group - LIBER Europe](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-digital-skills-services-working-group/) have lots of resources here, including a very useful diagram [Identifying Open Science Skills for Library Staff & Researchers](https://libereurope.eu/article/open-science-skills-diagram/)

- [LIBER Job Description Repository](https://libereurope.eu/job-descriptions/#descriptions) Contains job description examples for Digital Curator and other digital roles which reference the types of skills required for such work.

- [Europe’s Digital Humanities Landscape: A Study From LIBER’s Digital Humanities & Digital Cultural Heritage Working Group](https://zenodo.org/records/3247286#.ZGXqS7XMJjS) is a report based on a Europe-wide survey run by LIBER's Digital Humanities & Digital Cultural Heritage Working Group. The survey focused on digital collections and the activities libraries undertake around them. It covered the following topics and themes including staffing/skills

### Key Publications specific to digital scholarship and data science skills for research library staff
- The British Library and the Arts and Humanities Research Council published a report on skills: [Scoping Skills and Developing Training Programme for Managing Repository Services in Cultural Heritage Organisations](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/concern/reports/c87fd1ff-5ade-4367-8dc1-f94381c4b018). There is a very useful section (Section 3.) that references several other digital skills frameworks for research library staff across Europe.

### General Competencies for Librarians which include reference to digital 

- American Library Association (ALA) [Library Competencies (Various roles): Library Competencies | Tools, Publications & Resources (ala.org)](https://www.ala.org/tools/atoz/library-competencies) (USA)

- Canadian Association of Research Libraries [Competencies for Librarians in Canadian Research Libraries Publications and Documents](https://www.carl-abrc.ca/publications-and-documents/) (including specifically [Competencies-Final-EN-1-2.pdf](https://www.carl-abrc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Competencies-Final-EN-1-2.pdf) (Canada)

- CILIP: the library and information association [Professional Knowledge & Skills Base](https://www.cilip.org.uk/page/PKSB) - (UK)

## Hands-on activity and other self-guided tutorial(s)

Each Topic Guide on this site includes a range of specific hands-on activities and other self-guided tutorials colleagues across Europe personally recommend. When you’re ready to go further and have a better idea of the specific skills you need for a particular task, we can recommend having a good search through these excellent platforms which host or link to a great many in-depth training materials:

### DARIAH-Campus [https://campus.dariah.eu/](https://campus.dariah.eu/)
DARIAH is a pan-European infrastructure for arts and humanities scholars working with computational methods. It supports digital research as well as the teaching of digital research methods. Though not specific to the library professional context, tutorials here are useful for applying techniques to digital collections. 

### The Glam Workbench [https://glam-workbench.net/](https://glam-workbench.net/)
The GLAM Workbench is the brainchild of Tim Sherratt, a historian, and is a collection of Jupyter notebooks to help you explore and use data from GLAM institutions (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums). It includes tools, tutorials, examples, hacks, and even some pre-harvested datasets. It's aimed at researchers in the humanities but has useful tutorials for anyone interested in working with GLAM data.

### Ineo [https://www.ineo.tools/](https://www.ineo.tools/)
Ineo is a project developed and maintained by CLARIAH that lets you search, browse, find and select digital resources for research in humanities and social sciences. At the end of 2024 it will offer access to thousands of tools, datasets, workflows, standards and learning material. It is a work in progress so do keep that in mind when browsing.

### Library Carpentry [https://librarycarpentry.org/](https://librarycarpentry.org/)
Library Carpentry is an international volunteer community, under the Carpentries, focussed building software and data skills within library and information-related communities. The lessons here are meant to be taught as workshops led by a Carpentries certified instructor (for a fee) but you may find it useful to have a read through the content which is open and available to all. 

### The Programming Historian [https://programminghistorian.org/en/](https://programminghistorian.org/en/)
The Programming Historian has been publishing peer-reviewed tutorials on digital tools and techniques for humanists since 2008 and though they’re generally aimed at academic researchers, staff at British Library have found them highly useful over the years in their own work! 

### Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace [https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/search?order=score&categories=training-material](https://marketplace.sshopencloud.eu/search?order=score&categories=training-material)
Built as part of the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud project (SSHOC), the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Marketplace is a discovery portal which pools and contextualises resources for Social Sciences and Humanities research communities: tools, services, training materials, datasets, publications and workflows. The Marketplace highlights and showcases solutions and research practices for every step of the SSH research data life cycle. 

## Recommended Reading/Viewing  
There is no shortage of recommended reading lists out there, and again, each Topic Guide on this site will have their own recommended reading on a particular topic. These are all captured in our Zotero Library for Digital Scholarship and Data Science Topic Guides for Library Professionals.

Another great ongoing collection of projects, readings, initiatives, tools, and datasets that are in some way or another related to collections as data is [Zotero | Groups > collections as data - projects, initiatives, readings, tools, datasets](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2171423/collections_as_data_-_projects_initiatives_readings_tools_datasets). This group is an open resource, welcoming contributions from anyone who has a resource to share.

## Finding Communities of Practice

As you embark on learning more about digital scholarship and data science in a library context, you might want to explore and join existing communities of practice. 

### LIBER Working Groups
 
 Working groups are open to staff at participating [LIBER Member institutions](https://libereurope.eu/liber-participants/):
 - [LIBER Data Science in Libraries](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-data-science-in-libraries-working-group/)
 - [LIBER Digital Scholarship & Digital Cultural Heritage](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/digital-scholarship-and-digital-cultural-heritage-collections-working-group/)
