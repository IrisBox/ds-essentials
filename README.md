# Digital Scholarship & Data Science Topic Guides for Library Professionals

[Digital Scholarship & Data Science Topic Guides for Library Professionals](https://libereurope.github.io/ds-topic-guides/) is an open and collaboratively curated training reference resource. It aims to make it easier for LIBER library professionals and others to gain a concise overview of the new technologies that underpin digital scholarship and data science practice in research libraries today, and find trusted training materials recommendations to start their professional learning journey.

## About
_Digital Scholarship & Data Science Topic Guides for Library Professionals_ is a project that began in early 2023 as a joint collaboration between the Digital Scholarship & Digital Cultural Heritage ([DSDCH](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/digital-scholarship-and-digital-cultural-heritage-collections-working-group/)) and the Data Science in Libraries ([DSLib](https://libereurope.eu/working-group/liber-data-science-in-libraries-working-group/)).

In addressing some of these issues, _Digital Scholarship & Data Science Topic Guides for Library Professionals_ seeks to:

- Present a central destination for newcomers to become more familiar and conversant with the foundational concepts, methods and tools of digital scholarship and data science practice in libraries.
- Help library staff gain a better understanding of digital scholarship and data science practice in libraries by providing contextualised and gentle introductions to key topics through guides, self-guided training materials, project case studies, jargon busting and recommended reading lists
- Enable staff, in LIBER membership and beyond, to explore and immediately access a wealth of self and group study educational resources, available to them through a curated catalogue with faceted search and discovery
- Foster a culture of continuous learning and professional development and facilitate the development of localised training opportunities in LIBER institutions by providing guidance and training materials suitable for self and group study
- Offer a centralised, curated and trusted home for educators to contribute, and have reused, their high-quality training materials
- Raise awareness of local, national and international networks, and associated training events, relevant to delivering state of the art services in libraries
- Furnish current reports and competency skills frameworks pertaining to digital scholarship and data science in libraries
